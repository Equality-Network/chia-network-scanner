# Chia Network Scanner

Implements enough of the Chia peer protocol to perform a scan of full nodes connected to the Chia network.

This powers the node count charts of [Chia Explorer](https://www.chiaexplorer.com).

This is a MVP that make assumptions about peers on the network. Contributions are welcome to help battle harden it.

## WIP

The code is currently being extracted from another project and being wrapped with a nicer API.
