# Chia Network Scanner

Performs an asyncronous scan of the Chia network.

Rather than implementing a full node it communicates with another full node and requests it's peers - from there a graph traversal of the network is performed.

This powers the node count charts of [Chia Explorer](https://www.chiaexplorer.com).

## Usage

Here is an example of how to scan the Chia Network:

```javascript

```

Connection details for a node from which to start the scan must be provided.
